Hi Ben!

I feel bad about deciding how many hours I've worked, because I could quite easily produce the same presentation and say "yes, I've worked 5 hours" so this document will be my hours worked, what i've worked on, the dates worked on, my TODO list, things I've changed about the presentations and more. The "hours worked" is always rounded up to the nearest 5 minute interval. So if I've worked 25 minutes I'll round that up to 30 minutes purely because writing time as a fraction like 25/60 might get confusing.

So yeah, if this ever does get to some ridiculous time like 10+ hours (which I'm planning on because I want this presentation to be *absolutely the best* and I want every single person who sees this presentation to want to come here) then this will be a document detailing exactly what I've done to work those hours.


## Work hours
Hours worked | Date | What's been done 
--- | --- | ---
1 | 29/01/2018 | Initial setup - finding pictures, composing how i want it to look
1/2 | 29/01/2018 | Research - I wanted to see how other universities did presentations like this so I googled around and found quite a few of their presentations online. I have some nice slides to consider adding
1/6 | 29/01/2018 | Spent 10 minutes editing and putting photos into an album so I can include them in presentation. Will wait until Wednesday when I'm grading in Karate for proper photos as Karate will take a group photo of us. Shouldn't take too long to edit together a nice little 20 second movie about my first semester at university.

## ToDo List
ToDo | Done? | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Research other universities | 50% done | Need more data
Find a dyslexic friendly font to use | | *NOT* Comic Sans
Add more slides that explain the university | |
Add a "my story" section" | | 
Make sure to break the sterotype of american college vs british uni | | 
Make a movie of my first semester | | 
Promote Karate etc | | 
Explain the students union | | 

## What I've done
Added more pictures, less text. Steve Jobs had no text in his presentations, be like Steve Jobs.

Conflicting fonts - People have used *both* comic sans and arial on this presentation, making it look ugly. Fixed the fonts so they all match. Comic Sans is considered extremely ugly and a horrible graphical design choice.

Updated the powerpoint to use more modern memes. From my experience of presenting in schools students often engage more with memes, but not old person memes (defined as memes that are older than 5 months). Obviously this will go out of date quickly but it work's quite well if you update it alot.
