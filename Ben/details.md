This document outlines the creation of this presentation for Ben Toleman of the University of Liverpool

I feel bad about deciding how many hours I've worked, because I could quite easily produce the same presentation and say "yes, I've worked 5 hours" so this document will be my hours worked, what i've worked on, the dates worked on, my TODO list, things I've changed about the presentations and more. The "hours worked" is always rounded up to the nearest 5 minute interval. So if I've worked 25 minutes I'll round that up to 30 minutes purely because writing time as a fraction like 25/60 might get confusing.

So yeah, if this ever does get to some ridiculous time like 10+ hours (which I'm planning on because I want this presentation to be *absolutely the best* and I want every single person who sees this presentation to want to come here) then this will be a document detailing exactly what I've done to work those hours.


## Work hours
Hours worked | Date | What's been done 
--- | --- | ---
1 | 29/01/2018 | Initial setup - finding pictures, composing how i want it to look
1/2 | 29/01/2018 | Research - I wanted to see how other universities did presentations like this so I googled around and found quite a few of their presentations online. I have some nice slides to consider adding
1/6 | 29/01/2018 | Spent 10 minutes editing and putting photos into an album so I can include them in presentation. Will wait until Wednesday when I'm grading in Karate for proper photos as Karate will take a group photo of us. Shouldn't take too long to edit together a nice little 20 second movie about my first semester at university.
1/12 | 29/01/2018 | I spent 10 minutes outlining exactly what I need to do and any ideas. I halfed the time because I felt it was a bit tongue in cheek to get paid for outlining what to do. 1/12th of Â£8 is 0.60p :)
2/6 | 30/01/2019 | I spent 20 minutes researching new people who have uni degrees that younger audiences can relate to. I found photos of these people and reached out to see if I can use photos of them in a presentation (since you would otherwise have to use royalty free photos, which of people are hard to get). Not expecting a response but it was worth a shot :)
1 | 02/02/2018 | I've been interviewing people these past few days, formally too. I've got Pauline and Luis on board, just need Ian.
2 | 03/02/2018 | Oh god every single image is a JPG which makes it very ugly when put onto large screens. ALSO WHO USES COMIC SANS!?!?!??! I've had to remake almost everything in this presentation. Added more sections, added some interview stuff
1 | 03/02/2018 | researched celebrities who have degrees. Found JME & Sacher Baron Cohen so far. Need to find one more celebrity the students know that has an impressive degree. Also added some more slides and changed some more pictures. Why do people choose to use comic sans? 

## ToDo List
ToDo | Done? | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Research other universities | 50% done | Need more data
Find a dyslexic friendly font to use | | *NOT* Comic Sans
Add more slides that explain the university | |
Add a "my story" section" | | 
Make sure to break the sterotype of american college vs british uni | | 
Make a movie of my first semester | | 
Promote Karate etc | | 
Explain the students union | | 
Find out what qualfications are most needed for uni but tell them that they don't need to be 100% sure on what degree to get | | 
Tell them that when they pick it isn't the end of the world. You can change degrees and just having a degree will make you a million times better | | 
PAULINE NARVAS COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT NO DEGREE | | 

## What I've done
Added more pictures, less text. Steve Jobs had no text in his presentations, be like Steve Jobs.

Conflicting fonts - People have used *both* comic sans and arial on this presentation, making it look ugly. Fixed the fonts so they all match. Comic Sans is considered extremely ugly and a horrible graphical design choice.

Updated the powerpoint to use more modern memes. From my experience of presenting in schools students often engage more with memes, but not old person memes (defined as memes that are older than 5 months). Obviously this will go out of date quickly but it work's quite well if you update it alot.
